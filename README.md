# Empyro

Terminal emulator in python. Still in early development stage.

## Requirements

a `requirements-dev.txt` is provided. although not required as the only dependency
is used by `SurfaceTerminal`, an implementation of the `Terminal` ABC.

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Running The Tests

run the script `tests.py`, which will discover any module inside the
package `empyro` and run its doctests.
